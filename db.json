			"shortDescription": "The forest plays vital role in tribal culture. It not only provides food with rich variety of nutritious tubers, fruits, mushrooms, roots, and leaves but also generates ample forest produce like fruits, medicine, fodder, honey, gum etc. throughout the year. Hence forest is an indivisible part of tribal community’s living and its conservation ultimately helps them create new livelihood opportunities",

					"name": "Legal recognition and conservation of community forest",
					"shortDescription": [
						"Tribal people have been dependent on forest resources since centuries, but they had no right over it and consequently no responsibility for conserving it. Their forced alienation from the forest had disastrous effects for both forest and tribals. The new law in 2008 changed this and sought to end the ‘historical injustice’ of deprivation from forest rights. The enactment of law alone did not ensure the people exercising the rights. Vayam – after a hard struggle of 3 years – won the first CFR (Community Forest Rights) for four villages; viz. Kokanpada (22 ha.), Doyachapada (150 ha.), Dhadhri (284 ha.), and Ambyachapada (60 ha.). There are about 100 more villages in this tribal belt that are yet to get these rights. Vayam’s four have humbly paved the way",
						"Villagers from these four villages have initiated their drives towards community forest conservation. Villagers are abided by  Kulhadi-bandh and charai-bandh under CFRMC ( village committee). They designed their own watershed plan for village, built trenches, check dams etc."

						"The conservation has opened door to enough livelihood opportunities. The community is getting mobilized and has formulated its rules of judicious extraction from the forest. The extraction when coupled with processing will fetch a better value and income for the people. Commonly seen phenomenon is that of destruction being profitable than conservation. The idea of processing centre is to reverse this scene. People conserving the forest must prosper along with it.",
						"The processing centre coming up in village doyapada has oil expeller (for Mahua seed edible oil), solar conduction dryers (for forest fruit, leafs, and flowers), pulveriser for making powder of dried products, leaf-plate and leaf-bowl making machine , an eco-friendly low-carbon-footprint building to house all machines, solar energy for powering all machines. Farmers also adopted Treadle Pump technology. This has saved people’s money, diesel, and water. The JFMC has bought 10 solar conduction dryers. The dryers are being utilized to dry farm and forest produce."

Every child learns her own way to deal with the outside world.  In practice on the contrary we think that learning happens in schools. Schools and teachers  might accelerate the process but can’t be responsible for it.This natural process of learning ends when they are asked to write and read. Their self-earned knowledge has no value in schooling system. Hence Vayam has come up with education solutions that are beyond books and framed schools.",

These children – who have never seen expensive toys, successfully keep this kit in a good condition. We believe if the children learn to govern a community resource, they will surely govern and conserve their forests and rivers in future",

			"shortDescription": "The constitution of India in its Schedule VI has given special rights to scheduled tribe areas. The Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act has brought democracy to the remotest tribal hamlets. It has converged the traditional tribal practices of self-governance and the democratic rights bestowed by the constitution. But this empowerment has not percolated to the bottom of pyramid. Vayam is actively empowering tribal village assemblies in this mode of self-government – by constant training and hand-holding. These villages shall be self-reliant in terms of governance of natural resources (viz. water, forest, minor minerals). This will result in sustainable management of resources and also in mitigation of exploitation through control over resources.",

The central government initiated a program called GPDP (Gram Panchayat Development Plan) insisting on participatory planning at village level using the funds from Finance Commission. The percolation is a real challenge in our country with bureaucratic and socio-political bottlenecks.Vayam conducts training for village Panchayat members, village youth and women, and the local government staff.  Youth from Vayam team served as master trainers in GPDP reaching out to Gram Panchayats."

					"name": "Zero migration through NREGA",
					"shortDescription": [
						"The tribal areas are known for seasonal distress migration. The lack of irrigation and absence of job opportunities result in majority of young people migrating in search of unskilled labour work. NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) has on one hand assured the villages of unskilled employment in the village and on the other hand it holds huge potential for improving the natural resources. If NREGA is implemented in its true spirit, the lands, the water, the forest shall improve and in the long run – villagers will neither migrate nor ask government to provide work. For their rivers and ponds will have enough water to irrigate the farms throughout the year. This will provide self-reliant and sustainable employment to all the people skilled in farming (mistakenly called unskilled).",
						"Vayam has worked consistently on NREGA educating villagers and empowering them to get things done from the bureaucracy. Villagers in Dhadhri and Hateri have done wonders with this empowering support. Both villages had migration reduced by 80%. Vayam team is currently working on replicating this in 100 villages."

The low literacy levels, disguised un-education, poor road and internet connectivity, and degradation of natural resources (water and forest) are major destabilizing factors.

On the flip side, the opportunity is also a challenge for women to make their place in this male-dominated sector. The challenge is even bigger in the tribal areas of the state. The tribal women are new in the arena of running a local government. Given adequate training and handholding support, they can make a mark in governance at village level.",

Women earn a sense of honour by organising this ‘big event’ and by being the cynosure. The forest dwelling tribes have rich and independent sources of nutrition.
