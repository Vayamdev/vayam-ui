Vayam is actively empowering tribal village assemblies in this mode of self-government – by constant training and hand-holding.

The lack of irrigation and absence of job opportunities result in majority of young people migrating in search of unskilled labour work. NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) has on one hand assured the villages of unskilled employment in the village and on the other hand it holds huge potential for improving the natural resources. If NREGA is implemented in its true spirit, the lands, the water, the forest shall improve and in the long run – villagers will neither migrate nor ask government to provide work. For their rivers and ponds will have enough water to irrigate the farms throughout the year. This will provide self-reliant and sustainable employment to all the people skilled in farming (mistakenly called unskilled).",
					"Vayam has worked consistently on NREGA educating villagers and empowering them to get things done from the bureaucracy. Villagers in Dhadhri and Hateri have done wonders with this empowering support. Both villages had migration reduced by 80%. Vayam team is currently working on replicating this in 100 villages."

Vayam – after a hard struggle of 3 years – won the first CFR (Community Forest Rights) for four villages; viz. Kokanpada (22 ha.), Doyachapada (150 ha.), Dhadhri (284 ha.), and Ambyachapada (60 ha.).
