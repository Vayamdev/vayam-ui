We work with people who are deprived of their democratic rights and train them to fight for and achieve their rights in a democratic way. Vayam does this by empowering the people, especially tribal youth and women, with legal know how. Vayam regards people as participants not beneficiaries. It endeavours to develop community institutions for self-rule and governance of land, water, and forest. Village assembly (Gram Sabha), women’s SHG (self-help-groups) and of course youth leaders are some of the channels through which Vayam hopes to usher in change. At Vayam, people decide the priorities . Team Vayam evolves tools and techniques to bring the agenda to fruition. Work together: We believe that democracy is not only about electing representatives but by being actively involved in governance. We train our people to work with the government officials to bring about all benefitting changes. Vayam’s tools and techniques of building democratic strength is a freeware. It is freely shared with other organisations and active citizens. Many organisations have used Vayam’s methods to ensure a benefit far beyond Vayam’s reach. This ripple effect is our pride.",
